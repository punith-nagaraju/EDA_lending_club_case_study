# Lending Club Case Study

> As part of Lending Club, a consumer finance company, identify risky loan applicants who are likely to default in future. 
> 
> When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
> If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
> If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
> 
> This analysis is to be done using EDA over historical data available of all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011.
